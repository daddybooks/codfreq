# CodFreq
**Cod**on **Freq**uency Table Format

The HIVDB Sequence Reads Interpretation Program accepts a codon frequency table that stores in the **CodFreq** format. The CodFreq format consists of five columns:

1. gene (`PR`, `RT`, or `IN`);
2. position;
3. total number of reads of this position;
4. codon nucleotide triplet; and
5. total number of reads of this codon.


## Examples

Following listed 3 CodFreq files selected from studies with Illumina FASTQ sequence read files that are available online.
Due to browser restriction, please **right click** the link and select "**Save Link As...**" to download the file. Left
click the link will open the file in your browser and you have to save it through the "File" menu. Once you downloaded
one or more CodFreq files, you can submit it/them to [HIVDB Interpretation Program](/hivdb/by-reads/) for analysis.

## Create `.codfreq` file from `.sam`/`.bam` file

The `.sam` or `.bam` files are the alignment output from many multiple sequence alignment tools such as Bowtie2, BWA, SNAP, etc.

1. Install Docker CE (https://docs.docker.com/install/).

2. Download script:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivdb/codfreq/master/bin/sam2codfreq-docker -o /usr/local/bin/sam2codfreq
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sam2codfreq
   ```

3. Use following command to process FASTQ files and generate CodFreq files.

   ```bash
   sam2codfreq /path/to/folders/containing/sam-bam/files
   ```
   The script will automatically find every file named with an extension of `.sam` or `.bam`, then extract the codon freqency
   table into `.codfreq` file.

## Create `.codfreq` file from `.fastq`/`.fastq.gz` file

1. Install Docker CE (https://docs.docker.com/install/).

2. Download script:

   ```bash
   sudo curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivdb/codfreq/master/bin-wrapper/align-all-docker -o /usr/local/bin/fastq2codfreq
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fastq2codfreq
   ```

3. Download alignment profiles:

   ```bash
   mkdir profiles
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivdb/codfreq/master/profiles/HIV1.json -o profiles/HIV1.json
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hivdb/codfreq/master/profiles/SARS2.json -o profiles/SARS2.json
   ```

4. Use following command to process FASTQ files and generate CodFreq files.

   ```bash
   fastq2codfreq -r profiles/HIV1.json -d path/to/fastq/folders
   ```

   The script will automatically find every file named with an extension of `.fastq`, align them to `.sam` file and then extract
   the codon freqency table into `.codfreq` file.
   
   The above command is adequate for most case of both paired or unpaired FASTQ files generated by Illumina with the filename
   pattern looks like `*_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz` and `*_L001_R1_002.fastq.gz`. However, if your FSTAQ files are in other naming
   convention, please read [Advanced usages ยง Manually pairing FASTQ files](#manually.pairing.fastq.files).

Note: the `fastq2codfreq` script can only be executed in an Unix-like system. If you are using Microsoft Windows 10,
you need to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to
use this script.

### Advanced usages
#### Manually pairing FASTQ files
With paired FASTQ files, a single CodFreq file will be generated by the process. The program will try to match
the FASTQ files with similar names as paired FASTQ files. To change this behavior, a `pairinfo.json` file can be
supplied under the same folder that includes FASTQ files. Here is an example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "SRR13206501",
    "pair": [
      "SRR13206501_1.fastq.gz",
      "SRR13206501_2.fastq.gz"
    ],
    "n": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "SRR13180159",
    "pair": [
      "SRR13180159.fastq.gz",
      null
    ],
    "n": 1
  }
]
```
<!--

You can specify your FASTQ file naming convention by passing `-p <PATTERN>`, `-r <REPLACE>`, `-1 <PAIR1_SUFFIX>` and 
`-2 <PAIR2_SUFFIX>` parameters to `fastq2codfreq`. Noted `-p` and `-r` are paired regular expression replacement.
For example, if your FASTQ files are downloaded from Sequence Reads Archive (SRA), their naming convention would be
`*_1.fastq.gz` and `*_2.fastq.gz`. Here is the command:

```bash
fastq2codfreq -p '(.+)_[12]\.fastq\.gz$' -r '\1' -1 '_1.fastq.gz' -2 '_2.fastq.gz' /path/to/folders/containing/fastq/files
```

#### Specify concurrency rate
You can also specify concurrency rate (how many CPUs you want to use) by passing `-n <NTHREADS>` to `fastq2codfreq`.
By default, the script will use fomula `FLOOR(TOTAL_CPUS * 19 / 20)` to calculate the `NTHREADS` value.

```bash
# Use at most 5 CPUs
fastq2codfreq -n 5 /path/to/folders/containing/fastq/files
```

Note: if you are using Docker on Windows or MacOS, the upper limit of `NTHREADS` depends on the number of CPUs allocated
for the Docker software. Please check these general answers from Stackoverflow:
